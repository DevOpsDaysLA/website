## About Us

Now in its **10th** year, DevOpsDayLA is Southern California's only annual conference focused on the practice of DevOps - a proven, joint approach that emphasizes the need for collaboration between the Development (Dev) and Operations/IT (Ops) teams within an organization to continually deliver high-quality solutions. The event offers opportunities to learn and share experiences on topics such as:

- Automation
- Testing
- Security
- Organizational Culture
- Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
- Implementing DevOps practices
- and Career Development

The conference provides a relaxed, casual, and diverse environment where experienced professionals, evangelists, agile practitioners, developers, job seekers, business executives, educators, students, and curiosity seekers can connect and attend talks on current topics. DevOpsDayLA sponsors offer job opportunities, demonstrations of the latest tools, and world-class service offerings to facilitate organizations' DevOps journey.

DevOpsDay LA is presented in cooperation with the Southern California Linux Expo (SCALE). DevOpsDayLA will be held on Friday, March 4, 2022.
